# Pyrogram Types Overview
# Pyrogram Types provide objects and structures to interact with Telegram's API. Most types are automatically returned by methods and rarely need to be manually instantiated.

# Example Usage:
from pyrogram.types import User, Message

# Note:
# - Optional fields always exist but may be empty (`None`). Use a boolean check to confirm if a field is set: `if message.photo: ...`.
